   </div>
                           <p id="r"> 1. Definitions.<br></p>

         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,<br>
          and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.<br>

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by<br>
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.<br>

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all<br>

      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,<br>
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the<br>
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or<br>
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br>
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.<br>

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity<br>
      exercising permissions granted by this License.<br>

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,<br>
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation<br>
      source, and configuration files.<br>

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical<br>
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br>
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br>
      and conversions to other media types.<br>

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br>
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br>
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br>
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br>
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br>
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br>
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br>
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br>
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br>
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br>
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br>
<br>
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br>
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br>
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
<p id="r"> 2. Grant of Copyright License.</p> Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
<p id="r">  3. Grant of Patent License.</p> Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made<br>,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
<p id="r"> 4. Redistribution.</p> You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
      meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
<p id="r"> (a)</p> You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
      <p id="r"> (b)</p> You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
      <p id="r"> (c)</p> You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
          the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
      <p id="r"> (d)</p> If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute mu<br>st
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
          as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
<p id="r"> 5. Submission of Contributions.</p> Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
<p id="r">  6. Trademarks.</p> This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
<p id="red">  7. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p> Unless required by applicable law or<br>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
<p id="r">   8. Limitation of Liability.</p> In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
<p id="r">  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.</p> While redistributing<br>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability<br>
<br>
<p id="r"> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br></p>
<br>
<br>
<p id="o"> APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br></p>
<br>
      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br>
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br>
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include<br>
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate<br>
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a<br>
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the<br>
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier<br>
      identification within third-party archives.<br>
